# NI Replication and Deployment Utility

The NI Replication and Deployment (RAD) reference utility provides a turn-key solution for automated RT image deployment, replication, and management. It is built using functionality provided by the System Configuration VIs. This tool was previously known as the Real-Time Application Deployment (RTAD) utility, and archive versions can be found at Archive of the Real-Time Application Deployment (RTAD) Utility. The utility provides an easy-to-use interface for creating and deploying images from NI real-time targets. To learn more about configuration management with NI Real-Time devices, visit the Replication and Deployment (RAD) Utility White Paper.
